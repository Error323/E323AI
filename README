E323AI - High Templar

* If you want to make use of this AI do the following:
   1 git clone git://github.com/spring/spring.git
   2 cd spring
   3 git submodule update --init

  Of course, if you already have a clone of spring, just update.  To keep up to
  date, cd into the submodule and fetch,merge (like any normal git repo).
