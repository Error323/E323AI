BUGS:
* Factory queue (overflows)                                                            ✔
* Storage/factory creation (spawns multiple instances at the same time)
* Re-examine canAssist(), canAssistFactory() and canAffordToBuild()                    ✔
* Construction units comming out of factory (sometimes blocks further building)
* Running multiple E323AI instances (weird behaviour wrt mexbuilding)
* Attack assistance (groups try to attack target directly instead of going through pf) ✔
* Delete or fix merging                                                                ✔

FEATURES:
* Attacktask should provide finegrained control on units when pf is over:
	* Every unit should keep distance (80% of maxrange)
	* If blocked by obstacle, move on radial path or go in hightraj mode (when available)

* Create groups per factory            ✔
* Include movetypes in pathfinder      ✔
* Add defense matrix
* Tech 2 support                       ✔
* Dynamic group merging                ✔
* Terrain analysis
* Map resource reclaiming
* Unit categorization through configs  ✔
* Create a profiler class              ✔
* Restructure includes
