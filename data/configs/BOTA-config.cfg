# E323AI Configuration for version 3.x.x
#
# The A.I. can be considered as a state machine
# This config file lets you define:
#   o The number of states
#   o When a state becomes active
#   o What this implies for a certain state
#   o The state with the lowest integer number will be the initial state
#
# Each state needs 6 input fields (all integer numbers):
#   o A state becomes active iff metalIncome AND energyIncome is reached
#       - metalIncome: Amount of metal required for state activation
#       - energyIncome: Amount of energy required for state activation
#
#   o On an active state, the A.I. will try to satisfy the minWorkers,
#     minScouts by pushing the units in the factory with HIGH priority
#       - minWorkers: Minimal amount of workers
#       - maxWorkers: Maximal amount of workers
#       - minScouts: Minimal amount of scouts
#
#   o On an active state, the A.I. will only send an attack command for groups 
#     of units if the groupsize is atleast minGroupSize for a certain techlevel
#       - minGroupSizeTech1: Minimal number of units within a group for tech1
#       - minGroupSizeTech2: Minimal number of units within a group for tech2
#       - minGroupSizeTech3: Minimal number of units within a group for tech3
#
#   o On an active state, the A.I. will only build at techlevel maxTechLevel
#       - maxTechLevel: Maximal techlevel within this state
