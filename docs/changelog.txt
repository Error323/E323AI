E323AI changelog
----------------
v3.22.3 [2010-09-05]
* changed filename generation for log file: now includes short mod name and contains only safe path characters
* fixed filename generation for pathfinder graph cached data: no more semi-qualified filenames like "-graph.bin" 
* fixed possible temporary stall before the very first factory build (introduced in v3.22.2)
* fixed commander walking into enemy base on metall stall detection (probably)
* aircraft builders can always assist factories now, replacing ground assisters when limit per factory is reached; this is done to free factory exit in late game
* better metall stall and energy stall resolving; previous versions heavily depend on commander and also do not consider it can be dead
* fixed the problem when aircraft builders could not build some economy units (introduced in v3.21.2)
* partial tech 2 support for NOTA mod

v3.22.2 [2010-09-02]

v3.22.0 [2010-08-23]
* changed the way resource stall threshold values are calculated

* WIND & TIDAL tags removed
* fixed multiple AI info printing in chat
* added support for chat command "!e323ai" to visualize debug info (available for spectators only)

* tweaks to build second (etc.) factory earlier
* tweaks in target selection
* optimization in units regrouping
* support of geothermal energy makers
