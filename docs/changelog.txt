v3.22.4 [2010-09-08]
* full tech 2 support for NOTA mod (from technical point of view)
* fixed NOTA config file so tech 2 vehicles start being built (for ARM side only, CORE side is not updated at all)
* converted NOTA config file from DOS into UNIX text format
* fixed grouping of different types of units (air vs ground) if single factory can build both of them (Conflict Terra features this)
* fixed epic very old bug which made some types of units do not move because no path graph was calculated for them (this bug revealed in Conflict Terra only for kbots)
* added building multiple factories of the same type if they can't be assisted

v3.22.3 [2010-09-05]
* changed filename generation for log file: now includes short mod name and contains only safe path characters

* fixed possible temporary stall before the very first factory build (introduced in v3.22.2)
* fixed commander walking into enemy base on metall stall detection (probably)
* aircraft builders can always assist factories now, replacing ground assisters when limit per factory is reached; this is done to free factory exit in late game
* better metall stall and energy stall resolving; previous versions heavily depend on commander and also do not consider it can be dead
* fixed the problem when aircraft builders could not build some economy units (introduced in v3.21.2)
* partial tech 2 support for NOTA mod

v3.22.2 [2010-09-02]

* added Conflict Terra config files

v3.22.0 [2010-08-23]
* changed the way resource stall threshold values are calculated

* added CA config files
* fixed & tweaked BA, BOTA & XTA config files
* added basic compatibility with NOTA mod
* added NOTA config files (suitable for ARM side currently)

v3.21.2 [2010-08-06]

v3.21.1 [2010-05-19]
* fixed protential crash in UnitIdle callback
* somewhat fixed chasing after aircraft with non-aircraft groups

* fixed enemy scan procedure where ENGAGE groups preferred unarmed units
* fixed moveRandom() procedure which always returned results in lower-right corner relative to basic position in 2D plane
* anti-air aricraft will be set to guard factory when it is built

* WIND & TIDAL tags removed
* fixed multiple AI info printing in chat
* added support for chat command "!e323ai" to visualize debug info (available for spectators only)
